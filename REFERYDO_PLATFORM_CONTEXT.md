## 🎯 What is REFERYDO!?

REFERYDO! is a revolutionary Web3 talent marketplace built on the Stacks blockchain that transforms how freelancers, scouts, and clients connect and collaborate. Unlike traditional platforms that extract value, REFERYDO! distributes it fairly among all participants through smart contracts and guaranteed commissions.

It gives everyone the opportunity to offer a service, be discovered by others, and allow other users get clients for you, all while guaranteeing their commissions—a place where incentives are aligned for everyone!

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional freelance platforms:
- Charge predatory 20%+ fees
- Own your reputation and reviews
- Provide no incentive for referrals
- Have delayed and disputed payments
- Geographical limitations, payment systems that exclude some countries
- Lock you into their ecosystem

### Our Solution

REFERYDO! offers:
- **Fair 7% ecosystem fee** - Transparent, community-driven pricing
- **Sovereign on-chain reputation** - Your work history, owned by you forever. The proofs of your work are recorded in Stacks on BTC.
- **Guaranteed Scout commissions** - Every referral gets paid automatically to their wallets!
- **Instant smart contract payouts** - When the work is done, the money is distributed instantly. No delays, only blockchain
- **Three-way value creation** - Clients, Talent, and Scouts all win. Each user can operate in all 3 roles
